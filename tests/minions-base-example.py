Patient John Doe is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension. In his latest checkup, his blood pressure was recorded at 160/100 mmHg, and he reported occasional chest discomfort during physical activity.
Recent laboratory results show that his LDL cholesterol level is elevated at 170 mg/dL, while his HDL remains within the normal range at 45 mg/dL. Other metabolic indicators, including fasting glucose and renal function, are unremarkable.
